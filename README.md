# Doughnut Converter

This is a fun project that I'm building with Sara Clayton! 

## Description: 
After a hard work out, have you ever wondered how many doughnuts, ice cream, or any other amount of sweets you burned off? Well, this is what this website does! We take the number of calories you burned and we convert that to the number of doughnuts! 

## TODOs:
- [x] get doughnuts to render
- [ ] integrate with the Fitbit API
- [ ] integrate with Strava API
- [ ] make UI pretty

We hope you like it ^_^
